                    Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was 
                    released by Valve for Microsoft Windows in 2000, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Set in various 
                    locations around the globe, players assume the roles of counter-terrorist forces and terrorist militants opposing them. 
                    During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's 
                    objectives or eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at 
                    the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.

                    the Blood Elf prince Kael'Thas—as well as returning protagonist Arthas Menethil. Additionally, the expansion contains Act I

                    in December 2003, taking in player feedback of Act I when developing these chapters.

                    The Orange Box, for Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and has been since ported to other systems, including Mac OS X, 
                    Linux, Android (via Nvidia Shield), and Nintendo Switch. Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved 
                    by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", often referred 
                    to as the "portal gun", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, 
                    is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete 
                    each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the 
                    puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use 
                    of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular 
                    Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for 
                    the creation of Portal, making it a spiritual successor to the game.

                     It is the first installment in the Assassin's Creed series. The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events, 
                     taking place primarily during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. The player character is a modern-day man named 
                     Desmond Miles who, through a machine called the "Animus", relives the genetic memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. 
                     Through this plot device, details emerge about a millennia-old struggle between two factions: the Assassin Brotherhood 
                     (inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins), who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templar Order 
                     (inspired by the Knights Templar military order), who seek to establish peace through order and control. Both factions fight 
                     over powerful artifacts of mysterious origins known as "Pieces of Eden" to gain an advantage over each other. The 12th-century
                      portion of the story follows Altaïr, an Assassin, who embarks on a quest to regain his honor after failing to recover one 
                      such artifact from the Templars; he does so by finding and assassinating nine targets across the Holy Land.
