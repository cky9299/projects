         <h3>Our Organization</h3>
         <article>
            The history of games is huge, there are a lot of games in the past, 
            and even in the present, there are people who are working on producing high-quality games. 
            At the present, games mostly have supreme quality than the games in the past due to the use of new technologies, 
            such as motion capture, inverse kinematics, AI , and facial captures, to create them. But sometimes, 
            old games are better than present games because instead of the plot, the present games mostly focus on the performance of the games.
            So, if you are more of a plot person, then old games are definitely your taste. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although old games were very popular in the past, they were starting to be forgotten by the public in the present day. 
            Therefore, we organize an organization that is focusing on solving this problem. Our organization is called TARC Retro Games. 
            We are located at Kampus Utama, Jalan Genting Kelang, 53300 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur. 
            Our objective is to provide a platform to introduce classic games or retro games to people who are interested in those games, 
            and make more people familiar with the old games, and also provide the games to those who want to play them. 
            We have five members in our organization, and all of the members are gamers. 
            We have played a variety of games, including arcade games, console games, mobile games, and other games. 
            Hence, we are professionals in the gaming industry, and we want others to know how we feel. 
            Therefore, we organize an old games shop. But instead of just organizing and maintaining an old games shop, 
            we also gather information about other games shops and analyze the current trending topic inside the gaming circle. 
            Also, in order to make our job easier, we have managed to design and develop our own websites, all by ourselves. 
            Besides the renting fees for server, domain name and the copyright fees of other old games, we have done the design and development of websites all by ourselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all sorts of games, inside our physical shop and online shop. 
            The games that we can offer are many, including but not limited to Super Mario, Pokemon, Donkey Coin, Half Life, Call of Duty, Halo, Uncharted, GTA, 
            Witcher, Bioshcok, Hitman, The legend of Zelda, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Infamous, Donkey Kong, Pac Man and Final Fantasy. 
            We also include console games, PC games, PSP games and game boy games, and the games that originated from the 20 century to the early 21 century. 
            We also provide delivery service if the customer ordered the games online. So, this is everything about our organization.

         <h3>Objective of our website</h3>
         <article>
            Our website\'s objectives are to build a website that carries everyone's fond memories and ensure that classic games don't become the tears of the times.
            Therefore, we came up with several methods to implement our idea and divided these methods into two stages.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stage of our method is focusing on the games. 
            In this stage, we will collect as many popular games as possible from the 1980s until the 2010s. 
            This is because we believe that these popular games will resonate with both old and young players because we know that a game that is defined as a hit must have some influence no matter how much time and turmoil the game has gone through. 
            In addition, we will select 5 excellent games for each decades as recommendations. 
            We will also introduce each recommended game and attach our most real experience after playing it.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage of our method is focusing on the users. 
            In this stage, we will be focusing on improving the quality of our website to provide good experience to the users. 
            In order to facilitate users to buy the ideal game, we will create a product catalog for users to find the game they want and buy. 
            We will also provide questionnaires for users to fill out so that we can know the real feelings of users and help us to improve
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, due to the increasing number of Internet fraud cases, 
            we are also working hard to create a safe online shopping site to ensure that everyone can buy the games on our website without any worries. 
         </article>
         <br>
         <h3>Our games is real, not fake</h3>
         <article>
            There are so many fakes out there right now they're getting trickier and trickier today to spot. 
            Like our memories, we want our old games to be authentic, genuine and 100% original. 
            We have many checks in place, including but not limited to checking the cover of the games, quality of pin or cd, and the circuit board of the games.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a technician who is experienced in this sort of thing. He is an expert on the inside and outside of every game and console ever made. 
            He is in charge of the refurbishing process and quality control of every item here at TARC Retro Games. 
            Our old games look and work like new because we won't sell them if they don't.
