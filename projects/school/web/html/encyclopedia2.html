                     attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, renegade activity and are thereafter referred to as "Mavericks". \

                    The goal of the games is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight Gym Leaders and then the top four 
                    Pokémon trainers in the land, the Elite Four. Another objective is to complete the Pokédex, an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining 
                    the 151 available Pokémon. Red and Blue utilize the Game Link Cable, which connects two Game Boy systems together and allows Pokémon 
                    to be traded or battled between games. Both titles are independent of each other but feature the same plot, and while they can be 
                    played separately, it is necessary for players to trade between both games in order to obtain all of the original 151 Pokémon.
